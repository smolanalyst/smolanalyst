# Smolanalyst

Smolanalyst is a CLI tool for analyzing data files using an AI agent that dynamically generates and executes Python snippets. It is built on [Smolagent](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) and supports Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

## TODO

- Enable global CLI installation
- Ensure data files are within the current working directory
- Improve the system prompt
- Update Smolagentâ€™s system prompt instead of modifying the user prompt
- Remove web search from the base tools
- Support custom models via environment variables
- Integrate SciPy for statistical tests
- Consider adding Seaborn for enhanced visualizations
- Regularly test Smolanalyst to assess its capabilities ðŸš€

# Smolanalyst

Smolanalyst is a CLI tool for analyzing data files using an AI agent that dynamically generates and executes Python snippets. It is built on [Smolagent](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) and supports Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

## TODO

- Global CLI installation
- Allow users to specify custom models via environment variables
- Leverage agent memory to expose the file list and to provide more contextual instructions?
- How to restrict Pandas and Matplotlib from writing files outside the working directory and prevent overwriting existing files?
- Integrate SciPy for statistical analysis
- Implement regular testing to continuously evaluate Smolanalystâ€™s performance ðŸš€

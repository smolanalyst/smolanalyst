# Smolanalyst

Smolanalyst is an AI agent that analyzes data files by generating and executing Python snippets. Built on Hugging Face's [Smolagent](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents), it primarily runs through a CLI tool but can be integrated into other environments.

## TODO

- Global CLI installation and package distribution
- Improve CLI configuration prompting and look
- Implement the actual write control within the secure context
- Integrate SciPy for statistical analysis
- Implement regular testing to continuously evaluate Smolanalystâ€™s performance ðŸš€

# Smolanalyst

Smolanalyst is a CLI tool for analyzing data files using an AI agent that dynamically generates and executes Python snippets. It is built on [Smolagent](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) and supports Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

## TODO

- Global CLI installation and package distribution
- Allow users to specify custom models via environment variables
- Only run the code interpreter within the contexts, not the whole agent run?
- Find a more elegant way to augment the task as a prompt
- Integrate SciPy for statistical analysis
- Implement regular testing to continuously evaluate Smolanalystâ€™s performance ðŸš€
